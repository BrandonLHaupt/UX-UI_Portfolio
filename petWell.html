            Our goal was to make it easier for pet owners be reminded when their
            next vet appointment would be and when they need to give their pet
            their medicine

          I was the UI designer on the team along with a UX Researcher, UX
          Generalist, and four engineers. I was responsible for the product
          design and the UI experience for the app.

          This hackathon was a week long, my team and I tackled the issue of pet
          owners forgetting when to give their pets medicine or when to take
          them for their next vaccine appointment. We started to research how
          many pet owners have forgotten to give their pets medicine, what the
          symptoms were, or when their last vaccine was taken. From this
          research, we have discovered that it was a lot more than expected. Out
          of the 31 responses, 45.2% were not sure when their pet's vaccines
          were due and 64.5% of respondents did not remember any symptoms their
          pet had when taking medicine.

          The hackathon was a really enjoyable experience and I wanted to thank
          General Assembly for hosting this. I worked with many talented people
          on this project and it is amazing to see what we came up with in that
          short amount of time.
